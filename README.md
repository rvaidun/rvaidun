# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student at University of California at Santa Cruz and I'm studying Computer science. I'm currently looking for a Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2022. I mainly code in Python, C, Javascript, and Java. I'm interested in web development and am proficient in React.js and am currently learning other javascript frameworks such as Vue and Svelte.
