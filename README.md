# Hi there 👋
Hey, I'm Rahul. I'm a developer and graduated from the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science in June 2023. I'm currently working at [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com/) as a Software Engineer. I am working on the Catalog build team to help onboard merchants in the New Verticals space onto the platform.

I'm also working at [SV Financials](https://www.svfinancials.com/) , automating giving rate quotes for client scenarios.

Before Doordash, I was working at [Experian](https://experian.com/) as a Software Engineer. I was working on a platform to help financial institutions deploy and manage their machine learning models in the cloud. I also worked on a product in the model risk management space which helped institutions meet compliance requirements for their models in various regions.


Before Experian, I interned at [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) as a Solutions Engineer where I developed solutions and API's in Anypoint platform and created an enablement menu for the Channel Solution Engineer Team

When I'm not at the computer I enjoy hiking, skiing, running, and playing table tennis.
