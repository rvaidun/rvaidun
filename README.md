# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey, I'm Rahul. I'm a developer and graduated from the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science in June 2022. I'm currently working as a contractor at [Texts](https://texts.com/) building a universal chat client to bring all of your messages in one inbox.

I'm also working at SV Financials , automating giving rate quotes for client scenarios.
Before Texts, I interned at [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) as a Solutions Engineer where I developed solutions and API's in Anypoint platform and created an enablement menu for the Channel Solution Engineer Team

When I'm not at the computer I enjoy hiking, skiing, running, and playing table tennis
