# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey, I'm Rahul. I'm a developer and graduated from the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science in June 2022. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Experian](https://experian.com/). I am building a platform which help (financial) institutions deploy and manage their machine learning models in the cloud. 

I'm also working at SV Financials , automating giving rate quotes for client scenarios.
Before Experian, I interned at [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/) as a Solutions Engineer where I developed solutions and API's in Anypoint platform and created an enablement menu for the Channel Solution Engineer Team

When I'm not at the computer I enjoy hiking, skiing, running, and playing table tennis.
